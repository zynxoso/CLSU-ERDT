# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the existing bulk stipend notifications page to match the modern design pattern used throughout the CLSU-ERDT system. The current page uses an older design with basic rounded corners and inconsistent styling, while the new design should follow the modern card-based layout with proper spacing, consistent color schemes, and enhanced visual hierarchy seen in other pages like the stipend management index.
