# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CLSU-ERDT Scholar Management System currently has a critical authentication session management issue where logging out as a scholar and then accessing the admin login page automatically redirects to the admin dashboard without proper authentication. This occurs because both admin and scholar authentication use the same session guard without proper session isolation and cleanup. This security vulnerability allows unauthorized access and needs immediate resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session isolation between scholar and admin authentication, so that logging out from one role completely prevents access to other roles without re-authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scholar logs out THEN the system SHALL completely clear all authentication session data
2. WHEN an admin logs out THEN the system SHALL completely clear all authentication session data  
3. WHEN a user accesses any login page after logout THEN the system SHALL require fresh authentication credentials
4. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected route after logout THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the system to prevent cross-role authentication persistence, so that scholar logout cannot leave admin sessions active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scholar logs out and then accesses admin login THEN the system SHALL require admin credentials
2. WHEN an admin logs out and then accesses scholar login THEN the system SHALL require scholar credentials
3. WHEN any user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all related session tokens and cookies
4. IF a user tries to access a dashboard after logout THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page with an authentication error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper authentication guard separation, so that different user roles have isolated authentication contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system authenticates a scholar THEN it SHALL use a dedicated scholar guard
2. WHEN the system authenticates an admin THEN it SHALL use a dedicated admin guard  
3. WHEN logout occurs THEN the system SHALL clear the specific guard's authentication state
4. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL verify against the appropriate guard for the user role

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want consistent logout behavior across all user roles, so that logout always results in complete session termination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear all session data including cookies
2. WHEN logout completes THEN the system SHALL regenerate the session token
3. WHEN logout completes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate login page
4. WHEN accessing any protected route after logout THEN the system SHALL require fresh authentication
