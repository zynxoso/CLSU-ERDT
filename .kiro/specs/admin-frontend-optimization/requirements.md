# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin interface is experiencing frontend performance and interaction issues where users need to double-click elements and pages reload instead of properly redirecting. This affects user experience across all admin pages and needs systematic optimization to ensure smooth, single-click interactions and proper navigation behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want single-click interactions to work immediately, so that I don't have to click twice to perform actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks any button or link THEN the system SHALL respond on the first click
2. WHEN an admin clicks a navigation element THEN the system SHALL not require a second click to activate
3. WHEN an admin interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL register the interaction immediately
4. WHEN an admin clicks action buttons (edit, delete, view) THEN the system SHALL execute the action on first click

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want proper page navigation without unwanted reloads, so that I can move between pages efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks a navigation link THEN the system SHALL redirect to the target page without reloading the current page
2. WHEN an admin submits a form THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate success page
3. WHEN an admin cancels an action THEN the system SHALL return to the previous page without unnecessary reloads
4. IF a page needs to refresh THEN the system SHALL only refresh when explicitly required by the business logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want consistent JavaScript and Livewire behavior across all admin pages, so that interactions work predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Livewire components are loaded THEN they SHALL initialize properly without conflicts
2. WHEN JavaScript events are bound THEN they SHALL not create duplicate event listeners
3. WHEN admin navigates between pages THEN JavaScript state SHALL be properly managed
4. WHEN Livewire and vanilla JavaScript interact THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want fast page load times and responsive interactions, so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin loads any admin page THEN the page SHALL load within 2 seconds
2. WHEN an admin interacts with dynamic elements THEN the response SHALL be immediate (under 300ms)
3. WHEN admin pages contain large datasets THEN pagination or lazy loading SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized and cached appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want proper error handling and feedback, so that I understand when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a click fails to register THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
2. WHEN a navigation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and handled gracefully
4. WHEN Livewire requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
