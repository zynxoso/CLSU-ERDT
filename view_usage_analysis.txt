=================================================
CONCLUSION: All view files found in the directory listing appear to be used based on the comprehensive search results. No unused view files were identified.

The Laravel application follows standard conventions and all views are properly referenced through:
1. Controller methods returning views
2. Route definitions
3. Livewire component views
4. Blade directives (@extends, @include, @component)
5. Dynamic view loading patterns

No files should be removed as they are all actively used in the application.
