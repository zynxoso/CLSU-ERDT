# CLSU-ERDT Scholar Management System - Development Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the development methodology adopted for the CLSU-ERDT Scholar Management System, a comprehensive web application designed to manage scholar documents and fund disbursements. The methodology combines Agile development practices with Laravel-specific implementation patterns to ensure efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.

## Development Approach

### Agile Methodology

The project follows an iterative Agile approach with:

- **2-Week Sprints**: Development cycles with defined deliverables
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Brief team meetings to discuss progress and blockers
- **Sprint Planning**: Establishing sprint goals and task prioritization
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstrations of completed features
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: Team reflection on process improvements

### Development Lifecycle

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Stakeholder interviews
   - User story creation
   - Acceptance criteria definition

2. **Design Phase**
   - Database schema design
   - API endpoint planning
   - UI/UX wireframing and prototyping

3. **Implementation**
   - Feature development based on sprint priorities
   - Test-driven development (TDD) approach
   - Code reviews via pull requests

4. **Testing**
   - Unit and feature testing
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing (UAT)

5. **Deployment**
   - Staging environment validation
   - Production deployment
   - Post-deployment monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns

- **MVC Architecture**: Strict adherence to Laravel's Model-View-Controller pattern
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access layer for better testability
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulating complex business logic
- **Policy-based Authorization**: Using Laravel's native policy classes
- **Event-driven Architecture**: For workflow transitions and notifications

### Code Organization

- **Domain-driven Modules**: Organizing code by business domains (Scholar, Fund Request, Manuscript)
- **Feature-based Structure**: For larger modules, using feature-based organization
- **Shared Components**: Common utilities and services in dedicated namespaces

### Database Approach

- **Migrations-first Development**: Creating and maintaining database structure via migrations
- **Eloquent ORM**: Leveraging Laravel's ORM for database operations
- **Seeder-based Testing**: Using database seeders for test data
- **Transaction Management**: For ensuring data integrity in multi-step operations

### Testing Strategy

- **PHPUnit Framework**: For unit and feature tests
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Targeting 80%+ code coverage
- **Automated Testing**: Via CI/CD pipeline
- **Mock Objects**: For testing components with external dependencies

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Tools

- **PHP_CodeSniffer**: For enforcing coding standards
- **PHPStan**: Static analysis for detecting potential bugs
- **Laravel Telescope**: For debugging and performance monitoring
- **PHP Insights**: For code quality metrics

### Performance Optimization

- **Query Optimization**: Proper indexing and eager loading
- **Caching Strategy**: Using Redis for caching frequent queries
- **Asset Bundling**: With Vite for frontend optimization
- **Queue Management**: Using Laravel Horizon for background processing

### Security Practices

- **Input Validation**: Thorough request validation
- **CSRF Protection**: For all form submissions
- **XSS Prevention**: Through proper output escaping
- **Role-based Access Control**: Using Spatie Permissions package
- **Audit Logging**: For sensitive operations

## Collaboration Workflow

### Version Control

- **Git Flow**: Feature branches, develop branch, and main branch
- **Semantic Versioning**: For release management
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Required code reviews before merging

### Documentation

- **Inline Documentation**: PHPDoc standards for code documentation
- **API Documentation**: Using Swagger/OpenAPI specification
- **Wiki-based Knowledge Base**: For developer and user documentation

### Communication Channels

- **Issue Tracking**: Using GitHub Issues for task management
- **Team Collaboration**: Regular sync meetings and communication tools
- **Client Updates**: Scheduled demo sessions and progress reports

## Project Phases and Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (4 weeks)
- Core authentication system
- Scholar management CRUD
- Basic fund request submission

### Phase 2: Core Features (6 weeks)
- Complete workflow engine
- Disbursement processing
- Manuscript system
