Project Overview Update: Theme Implementation
Objective: Integrate a user-toggleable dark/light theme system matching the modern aesthetic of the Fowers&Saints dashboard while maintaining ERDT branding.

1. Theme System Requirements
Toggle Mechanism:

Add a theme switcher (sun/moon icon) in the navigation header.

Store user preference in localStorage with default to OS preference via prefers-color-scheme.

Design Consistency:

Mirror Fowers&Saints’ card-based layout with soft shadows and rounded corners.

Use ERDT’s brand colors (#3498db for primary, #2ecc71 for secondary) in both themes.

Key UI Components to Theme:

Dashboard cards (analytics, recent transactions, quick actions).

Data tables (fund requests, manuscripts).

Forms and buttons.
